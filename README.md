# Guide to Synthesis

This will be a series of short talks with audio samples and pictures on the subject of audio synthesis.

The series aims to take a complete beginner from zero knowledge up to being able to work with common synthesizers to create new sounds with a complete understanding of what they are doing.

Recordings will be released on [HPR](http://www.hackerpublicradio.org/index.php) as and when I get around to recording them.

Recordings are made using [Ardour](https://ardour.org/) on [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/). Synthesizer audio examples are made using the [Arturia MiniBrute 2](https://www.arturia.com/products/hardware-synths/minibrute-2/overview).
